Thanks for the clarification! Let's refocus the presentation to emphasize the core problem of fraud professionals targeting common citizens. We'll highlight how "Credible" addresses this issue by empowering individuals to verify the authenticity of professionals in real-time. Here’s how we can structure the presentation:

### [Credible]
*A platform to protect common citizens from fraud professionals.*

---

### Slide 1: Introduction
**Title:** "Credible: Protecting Citizens from Fake Professionals"

**Subtitle:** Enabling anyone to instantly verify the legitimacy of professionals using blockchain-based ID verification.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** The Rise of Fake Professionals

- **Growing Fraud:** In developing countries like India, scams involving individuals impersonating professionals (e.g., government officers, army personnel) are on the rise. This affects millions of citizens each year.
- **Lack of Verification:** Citizens often cannot distinguish between real and fake professionals since they don't know what official ID cards look like.
- **Common Scams:** Fake railway officers, police impersonators, and fraudulent job recruiters are frequently reported.
  
**Data Support:**
- According to *The Times of India*, over 1,500 cases of impersonation-related fraud were reported in 2023.
- A 2022 survey found that 40% of Indian citizens feel uncertain about verifying the authenticity of professionals they encounter daily.

### Slide 3: The Consequences
**Title:** Real Impact on Citizens

- **Financial Loss:** Victims of scams often suffer significant financial losses. For example, fraudsters posing as army officers collect money for "fake" recruitment drives.
- **Emotional Toll:** People feel betrayed when they discover they have been scammed by someone they thought was a trusted professional.
  
**Data Support:**
- A *World Bank* report indicates that over $2.6 billion is lost annually in India alone due to impersonation scams.
- Psychological studies show that victims of fraud experience long-term trust issues and anxiety.

### Slide 4: The Current System Fails
**Title:** Why Current Solutions Are Ineffective

- **Uninformed Citizens:** Common citizens do not have access to systems to check the authenticity of professionals.
- **ID Cards are Easily Forged:** With modern printing technology, fake ID cards are easy to produce, and most citizens are unable to identify fake IDs.
  
**Competitor Analysis:**
- Traditional ID verification relies on manual checking, which is slow and error-prone.
- Current solutions like KYC platforms focus on businesses rather than helping common citizens in real-time.

### Slide 5: Credible's Solution
**Title:** Credible: Verifying Professionals in Real-Time

- **Simple and Accessible:** Citizens scan a QR code on a professional's ID card, which redirects them to Credible, displaying key verified information (employer, issue date, designation) stored on Solana blockchain.
- **Immutable and Secure:** Since the data is stored on a blockchain, it is tamper-proof and can be trusted.
- **Free for Citizens:** Basic ID verification (1-2 checks daily) is always free for individuals, ensuring accessibility for all.

### Slide 6: How Credible Works
**Title:** Verifying a Professional in Three Easy Steps

1. **Scan the QR Code:** Citizens scan the ID card’s QR code with their phone.
2. **Access Verification Details:** The platform retrieves the professional's details from the blockchain and displays them instantly.
3. **Verify Instantly:** Check key data (e.g., employer name, designation) to ensure the individual is legitimate.

### Slide 7: Real-World Use Cases
**Title:** Empowering Citizens to Fight Fraud

1. **Spotting Fake Government Officers:** A citizen encounters a person claiming to be a police officer. With Credible, they can instantly verify the officer's credentials.
2. **Job Recruitment Scams:** Individuals approached by "job recruiters" can scan their ID cards to check if they are real recruiters.
3. **Financial Fraud Prevention:** Before handing over sensitive documents to a "bank officer," customers can verify their legitimacy through Credible.
